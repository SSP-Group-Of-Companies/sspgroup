        question: "What freight modes does NPT Logistics offer?",
        answer:
          "We offer full truckload (FTL), less-than-truckload (LTL), expedited and specialized, temperature-controlled, hazmat, and cross-border and global services. Each mode is designed for specific lane, timeline, and compliance needs—we help you match the right mode to your shipment.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I get a quote?",
        answer:
          "Request a quote through our website or contact operations. For the fastest response, provide lane (origin and destination), weight and dimensions, pickup and delivery windows, and any special requirements (temperature, hazmat, customs). We typically respond with a structured quote within one business cycle.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you handle cross-border shipments?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We coordinate Canada–U.S. and Mexico cross-border moves with documentation readiness, broker handoffs, and milestone visibility. We also support ocean and air freight for international lanes. Tell us your origin, destination, and commodity and we’ll outline the process and timing.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is your coverage area?",
        answer:
          "We operate across North America with offices and capacity in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. We provide a single point of accountability for domestic and cross-border lanes rather than handing you off between regional brokers.",

    items: [
      {
        question: "How do you ensure carrier safety and compliance?",
        answer:
          "We vet carriers before dispatch: current insurance, authority, and safety ratings are verified. No load moves without documented compliance. We monitor safety scores and maintain audit-ready documentation so you have one accountable partner.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you handle hazmat or regulated freight?",
        answer:
          "Yes. We move hazardous and regulated freight with the required documentation, placarding, and carrier credentials. Share your commodity and UN/class and we’ll confirm capability and compliance steps before booking.",
      },
      {
        question: "What documentation do you provide?",
        answer:
          "We provide BOLs, PODs, and any lane-specific documents (e.g. customs, temperature logs). Documentation is stored and available for audit. We can align with your record-keeping and EDI/API needs where applicable.",

      },
      {
        question: "Who do I contact for updates or issues?",
        answer:
          "Your load has a single point of ownership from dispatch through delivery. Operations coverage is available so you have a clear escalation path. Contact details are provided at booking and in confirmation communications.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if there’s a delay or exception?",
        answer:
          "We manage exceptions with root cause, corrective action, and revised ETAs—documented and communicated. We don’t leave you in the dark; we outline what’s happening and what we’re doing to get the load back on plan.",

        question: "How does billing work?",
        answer:
          "We issue a single invoice per load (or as agreed for dedicated programs). Payment terms are confirmed at booking. You get one statement and one relationship—no chasing multiple carriers or brokers for the same move.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work with freight brokers or only direct shippers?",
        answer:
          "We work with shippers, 3PLs, and brokers. Our model is built for disciplined execution and clear accountability whether you’re shipping direct or through a partner. We can align to your procurement and reporting requirements.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can we integrate with our TMS or ERP?",
